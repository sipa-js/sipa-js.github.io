# Templating with EJS

Sipa uses [EJS](https://ejs.co/) as templating engine for its pages and layouts.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.

So it is possible to use all JavaScript features within your templates, like loops, conditions, functions, etc...

This makes it very powerful and flexible to create dynamic pages and layouts. And you do not need to learn a new templating language, as it is just JavaScript.

Checkout the [EJS documentation](https://ejs.co/#docs) for more information and examples on how to use EJS templating.

## Examples
Here we will provide some simple examples of EJS templating features you can use in your Sipa pages and layouts.
