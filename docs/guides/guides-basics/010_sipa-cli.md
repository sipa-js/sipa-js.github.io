# Sipa CLI

Sipa provides a powerful command line interface (CLI) to support the developer on his daily work.

:::info
Usually you just use the `sipa` command. For backward compatibility you can still use the long name `simpartic`.
:::

With the Sipa-CLI you can do the following, for example
* Create new projects
* Start and run a live webserver with on the fly SCSS processing
* Generate new pages, js libraries or layouts
* Automatically include or exclude new files or libraries
* Create minified distribution builds
* Update your project to the latest Sipa version
* Upgrade the Sipa CLI to the latest Sipa version
* ... so much more!

To list all available commands, just run `sipa` on the command line.

All commands have shortcuts that you can use, so for example all of the following commands are the same:
```yaml
sipa         # without command, it defaults to 'help'
sipa help    # long command name
sipa h       # short cut suggested to use
sipa -h      # alias
sipa --help  # alias
```
