# Create a new page

Sipa projects are structured into logical pieces called "pages".

They are stored in your project at `app/views/pages`.

A page consists of 
* a HTML template file
* a JS page file
* a SCSS style sheet file (and its compiled CSS file)

## Page life cycle

Before a page is loaded, a layout will be loaded first, and then the page will be put into the layout and rendered.

```md title="page life cycle"
Trigger Page Load -> Applied Layout is loaded (if not already present) -> Page is loaded
```

## Load another Page
Another pages can be loaded with `SipaPage` class. When using `onsenui` and mobile development, use the `SipaOnsenPage` class the same way!

```js
// desktop
SipaPage.load('imprint', options);
// onsenui
SipaOnsenPage.load('imprint', options);
```

## Create a new page

To create a new page, we use the Sipa CLI with its generators at the root directory of our Sipa project:

```bash
# start generator
sipa g
# choose page
p
# enter page name for e.g. settings page
settings
# or even sub settings pages
settings/user
```

### Structure

A page consists always of 3 (4) files:
```
├── settings.js
├── settings.html
├── settings.scss
└── settings.css
```

Never modify the `css` file manually, as it is automatically compiled and overwritten by the `scss` source file!

In the `scss` file you can even use only CSS, as SCSS is a superset of CSS.

If you do not know SCSS, a variant of SASS, yet, you should start know learning it!

The official website with examples and documentation can be found at https://www.sass-lang.com/

### JS page file
The JS page file is the controller of your page. Here you can define the life cycle methods of your page, like `onInit` and `onDestroy`.

```js title="settings.js"
class SettingsPage extends SipaBasicView {
    static onInit() {
        const self = SettingsPage;
        console.log('Settings page initialized');
        self._loadSomeData();
    }

    static onDestroy() {
        console.log('Settings page destroyed');
    }

    static save() {
        // save settings with ajax call to backend API
    }

    static _loadSomeData() {
        // load some data for the page
    }
}
```

### SCSS style sheet file
The SCSS style sheet file is where you can define styles for your page.

When using the generator, a basic style with the page selector is already included.

```scss title="settings.scss"
*[data-page-id='settings'] {
    // Your styles here, that apply only to this page
}
```

If you want to style elements in general, that are not specific to this page only, create a general style file.
Inside the style file of your page, you usually only make special adjustments for this page or if you have something uniq on this page.

### HTML template file
The HTML template file is where you define the structure of your page.

```html title="settings.html"
<div class="settings-page">
    <h1>Settings Page</h1>
    <form>
        <label for="username">Username:</label>
        <input type="text" id="username" name="username">
        <button type="button" onclick="SettingsPage.save()">Save</button>
    </form>
</div>
```
