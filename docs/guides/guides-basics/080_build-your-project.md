# Build your project

Sipa provides tools to create a production build.

## Why a production build?
For production we can concat all the JavaScript (.js) and stylesheet (.css) files each into one file. Then we can compress these files by removing comments, new lines and even minify some code.

That results in smaller files to deliver on the one hand, on the other hand it prevents others to copy our original clean code.

## Common build process

By default Sipa only considers your view `.html` files, you stylesheets `.css` and javascript files `.js` of your assets directory, including font files that are used inside the stylesheets. Then it generates a minified `index.html` based on your development file.
Additional custom static files for the distribution build must be specified in the `sipa.json`. See the options below in this document for more information.

## Create a production build
To create a production build, just run
```
sipa b
```
inside your project root directory.

Sipa will then create a production build inside
```
/dist/default
```
which is intended to be versioned and committed in your project.

### Options
There are some options available for your production build that you can set in your `sipa.json` inside the `build: {}`node.

In the following is an example how the node could look like in real project. After the attributes are described.
```yaml
# sipa.json
{
...
  "build": {
    "auto_fix_font_paths_in_css": true,
    "minify": {
      "css": {
        "remove_comments": true,
        "compress": true
      },
      "js": {
        "remove_comments": false,
        "compress": true
      }
    },
    "static_files_to_copy": {
      "files": "files",
      "assets/img": "assets/img",
      "favicon.ico": "favicon.ico",
      "manifest.json": "manifest.json"
    }
  }
...
}
```
