# Add or remove libraries

When working on a project you often want to add a (S)CSS framework of your choice or need to add a JavaScript library that offers some special features you want to use.

Adding them to your project is very easy by using the Sipa Indexer. 

:::info Sipa Indexer
Sipa Indexer is a command line tool that can be run by `sipa indexer` or its shortcut `sipa i` at the root of your project directory. It scans for files that have not been included to your `index.html` already and for files that are included there but do not exist anymore.

Then you can decide what files you want to include/exclude or ignore. Sipa indexer then will do the job for you automatically.
:::

## Example #1: Adding a simple example library

Let's assume we have a library called `foobar` which consists of two files, `code.js` and `style.jss`.

So we just create a folder `foobar` inside `app/assets/lib` and put these two files into it.

Then the file structure should look like this:

```
├── app
│ └── assets
│   └── lib
│     └── foobar
│       ├── style.css
│       └── code.js
```

Then we run `sipa i` and get the following output:

```
Files not ignored in sipa.json or not included in index.html

  → [0] assets/lib/foobar/code.js
  → [1] assets/lib/foobar/style.css
```

We just enter `0,1` to explicitly add these two files, or easier just `+` (plus) to add all listed files, automatically into our `index.html`.

That's it! The files are included and can be used in our project.

:::info Adding or ignoring files with Sipa indexer
You can add several files from the list you get by running `sipa i` explicitly separated by comma and optional `+` (plus) prefix.
To ignore, you prefix the numbers with a `-` (minus).

You even can combine both, for example: `1,5,-3,2,-4`. That will add `1,2,5` and put `3,4` to the ignore list.

To add or ignore the whole list, just type `-` (minus) or `+` (plus).

## Example #2: Adding compiled Bootstrap 5 to your project

Download the latest compiled distribution [release from Github](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases). You need the asset ending with `*-dist.zip`, for example [`bootstrap-5.3.3-dist.zip`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/download/v5.3.3/bootstrap-5.3.3-dist.zip).

### Put files into project

Unzip the bootstrap archive in your project at `app/assets/lib/boostrap5`, so the file structure looks like this:

```
├── app
│ └── assets
│   └── lib
│     └── bootstrap5
│       └── css
│         ├── bootstrap.css
│         ├── bootstrap.rtl.css
│         ├── bootstrap.grid.css
│         ├── ...
│         └── bootstrap.utilities.rtl.css
│       └── js
│         ├── boostrap.bundle.js
│         ├── boostrap.esm.js
│         ├── ...
│         └── boostrap.js
```

### Run Sipa Indexer

The only files we want to include to our project index.html, are `bootstrap.min.css` and `bootstrap.bundle.js`.

With Sipa Indexer, we can include, exclude an ignore files automatically to our `index.html` at the right place.

So we run `sipa i` on the command line in our project directory and get the following output:

```
Files not ignored in sipa.json or not included in index.html

  → [0] assets/lib/bootstrap5/js/bootstrap.bundle.js
  → [1] assets/lib/bootstrap5/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js
  → [2] assets/lib/bootstrap5/js/bootstrap.esm.js
  → [3] assets/lib/bootstrap5/js/bootstrap.esm.min.js
  → [4] assets/lib/bootstrap5/js/bootstrap.js
  → [5] assets/lib/bootstrap5/js/bootstrap.min.js
  → [6] assets/lib/bootstrap5/css/bootstrap-grid.css
  → [7] assets/lib/bootstrap5/css/bootstrap-grid.min.css
  → [8] assets/lib/bootstrap5/css/bootstrap-grid.rtl.css
  → [9] assets/lib/bootstrap5/css/bootstrap-grid.rtl.min.css
  → [10] assets/lib/bootstrap5/css/bootstrap-reboot.css
  → [11] assets/lib/bootstrap5/css/bootstrap-reboot.min.css
  → [12] assets/lib/bootstrap5/css/bootstrap-reboot.rtl.css
  → [13] assets/lib/bootstrap5/css/bootstrap-reboot.rtl.min.css
  → [14] assets/lib/bootstrap5/css/bootstrap-utilities.css
  → [15] assets/lib/bootstrap5/css/bootstrap-utilities.min.css
  → [16] assets/lib/bootstrap5/css/bootstrap-utilities.rtl.css
  → [17] assets/lib/bootstrap5/css/bootstrap-utilities.rtl.min.css
  → [18] assets/lib/bootstrap5/css/bootstrap.css
  → [19] assets/lib/bootstrap5/css/bootstrap.min.css
  → [20] assets/lib/bootstrap5/css/bootstrap.rtl.css
  → [21] assets/lib/bootstrap5/css/bootstrap.rtl.min.css
```

As we need only `bootstrap.min.css` and `bootstrap.bundle.js`, we type
```
5,19
```

and press enter. Then this two files will be included to our `index.html`.

After that we run `sipa i` again and just type `-` (minus) and press enter to ignore all other files in future. 

Ignored files are stored in the `sipa.json` configuration where you can remove them, if you don't want to ignore them anymore.

Now Bootstrap5 is successfully integrated and you can use it!

## Example #3: Adding source Bootstrap 5 to your project

In this case we want to use the source Bootstrap 5 files with its SCSS, to be able to modify its configuration.

Download the latest source [release from Github](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases). You need the asset called `Source code (zip)`, for example [`Source code (zip)`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/archive/refs/tags/v5.3.3.zip).


### Put files into project

Unzip the bootstrap archive in your project at `app/assets/lib/boostrap5`, so the file structure looks like this:

```
├── app
│ └── assets
│   └── lib
│     └── bootstrap5
│       └── scss
│         ├── ...
│         ├── bootstrap.scss
│         ├── bootstrap-grid.scss
│         ├── bootstrap-reboot.scss
│         └── bootstrap-utilities.scss
│       ├── js
│       ├── ...
```

### Run Sipa Indexer

We do not want to include any file of bootstrap directly into your project.

So we run `sipa i` and just enter `-` (dash/minus) to ignore all bootstrap files.

After that, we create a new file `app/assets/style/bootstrap5/bootstrap.scss`.

Inside this file we need to include the entry file of bootstrap and can already modify some bootstrap variables for adjustments.

In this example we overwrite the primary color.

```scss title=app/assets/style/bootstrap5/bootstrap.scss
$primary: #ff55e8;

@import "../../lib/bootstrap5/scss/bootstrap";
```

Ensure the live development server is running already, otherwise start it with `sipa s`. It will automatically create a `bootstrap.css` of your `bootstrap.scss`.

Then we run `sipa i` again and enter `+` to add the `bootstrap.css` to your project `index.html` file.

### Additional tips for customizing bootstrap

If you do lots of modifications, you may add a `overwrites/_variables.scss` in the same directory as your `bootstrap.scss` and import it in the latter.

```scss title=app/assets/style/bootstrap5/overwrites/_variables.scss
$primary: #ff55e8;
```

```scss title=app/assets/style/bootstrap5/bootstrap.scss
@import "overwrites/variables";

@import "../../lib/bootstrap5/scss/bootstrap";
```

:::caution SCSS file naming

Note, when `.scss` file names start with underscore, there will not automatically be generated a `.css` files of them. That is what you want, if you just want to create additional `.scss` files to structure your main `.scss` file.
Otherwise you would need to ignore that `.css` files with the sipa indexer explicitly.
