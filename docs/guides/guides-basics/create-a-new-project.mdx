# Create a new project
On the commandline run
```bash
sipa new
```
or just `sipa n` to create a new project as subfolder of the current directory.

A interactive setup assists you and generates the project depending on your input.

## Predefined project types

When you run the Sipa command to create a new project, you have the choice between `desktop` and `mobile`.

### desktop
`desktop` offers a very simple template that is typically [extended with a CSS framework of your choice](add-or-remove-libraries.md), or you can just write your own CSS if you are a CSS god!

### mobile
`mobile` offers a template based on [OnsenUI](https://onsen.io/), a very well designed mobile CSS framework with styled components for Android and iOS. Beneath it uses `SipaOnsenPage` instead of `SipaPage` by default, which provides almost a 1:1 wrapper and extension to work the same way with sipa as you are get used with `SipaPage` (like query parameter management, reload, etc...) by using [OnsenUI](https://onsen.io/).

## Running your project

After that, you can run your new project, when you run `sipa server` or just `sipa s` in its project root directory.

The development server will then automatically boot up and open your project in the web browser, containing a default layout and page.
